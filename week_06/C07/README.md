# Challenge 7

The challenge of this week was to pass the application to react and create some
component to interact with. Also some refactor to the REST API was done.

## Run the Bookshelves Application

This time the data is get directly from the db, so all books information is in
there. Then, the server of the API has to be running for the requests to be
made. The explanation to get the server of the REST API running is inside the
_/week_05/C06_ folder.

Once the REST API Server is prepared, run ```npm start``` inside the _bookshelves_
folder in the current directory.
